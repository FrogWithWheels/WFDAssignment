# Django website for food recruitment and training.
A project for my Web Frameworks Development module.
Unfortunately, I was unable to fully complete this assignment.
I'm aware that the work submitted is not fully what was asked for.
I encountered a lot of issues I could not find a fix for, most notably a ValueError that made the admin page inaccessible.

---
However, all code was written myself and I understand the module concepts well. I hope this project is still enough to get me some marks, and I appreciate the understanding.

What I accomplished:
- Database models.
- Github repository and understanding of repository management.
- Authentication.
- Django templates.
- General Django use.

What's not working:
- Admin page is not accessible.
- Login functionality does not work either.
- No real pages to show due to both issues above.
